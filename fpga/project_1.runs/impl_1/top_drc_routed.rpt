LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A1' of cell dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_N_EXT_BSCAN.bscan_switch/temp_curid[31]_i_1 (pin dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_N_EXT_BSCAN.bscan_switch/temp_curid[31]_i_1/I1) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O5=(A3*A2)+(A3*(~A2)*(~A5))+((~A3))'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue.
